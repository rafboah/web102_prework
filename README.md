## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A challenge I faced was in the use of the reduce function because I was new to it. Also, I faced a bit challenge in terms of using the filter function since it was a new concept to me. Lastly, in developing the search bar functionality, I faced a little challenge in terms of making the search bar functional which will enable users to input a search term for a game and the corresponding game gets displayed.
